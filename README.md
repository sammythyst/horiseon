## What was your motivation?
While it didn't impede the functionality of the website, the CSS code was frequently repetative and hard to read at first glance. My motivation for this project was to condense the repetative parts of the code and to give the HTML sections proper selectors.

## What problem did it solve?
Modifying the code of this project helped make the HTML code easier follow along and made the CSS easier to read, all while keeping functionality of the site as a whole the same.
